# üè° HomeRoom

HomeRoom is a digital platform designed to streamline the financial and organizational tasks involved in housing and rental management. Built with both landlords and tenants in mind, HomeRoom simplifies rental processes by offering a centralized system to handle administrative responsibilities, payment tracking, and communication between parties.

For landlords, HomeRoom provides an efficient way to manage households, monitor payment statuses, and oversee tenant activity. For tenants, it offers an accessible tool to track monthly dues, view rental history, and stay updated with household announcements.

By bridging the gap between landlords and tenants through a user-friendly and structured interface, HomeRoom aims to enhance transparency, reduce manual overhead, and foster better housing experiences for all users involved.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.
Laravel Herd is the recommended environment for this project, but alternatives are included below.

---

### 1. Set Up the Project Directory

If you're using **Laravel Herd**, run:

```bash
cd ~/Herd
```

Otherwise, use any location you prefer:

```bash
cd <your-project-folder>
```

Then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/COMP-016-Web-Development-Group-1/HomeRoom.git
```

After cloning, make sure you enter the project folder:

```bash
cd HomeRoom
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run build
```

---

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy the example `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and fill in the following fields:

```env
DEFAULT_LANDLORD_NAME=
DEFAULT_LANDLORD_EMAIL=
DEFAULT_LANDLORD_PASSWORD=
```

If you're using Laravel Herd, make sure to set:

```env
APP_URL=http://homeroom.test
```

Otherwise, keep the default:

### 4. Create the SQLite Database

This project uses SQLite for local development.

#### Mac/Linux or Git Bash:

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

#### PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType File -Path "database/database.sqlite"
```

#### CMD:

```cmd
type NUL > database\database.sqlite
```

Alternatively, you can **manually create a blank file** named `database.sqlite` in the `database` directory.

---

### 5. Generate App Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

---

### 6. Link Storage

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

---

### 7. Migrate and Seed the Database

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

---

### 8. Serve the Application

If you're using **Laravel Herd**, simply visit:

```
http://homeroom.test
```

If you're **not using Herd**, start the server with:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then visit the URL provided in the terminal, e.g.:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Developing

Common tasks while working on the project:

### Recompile Frontend Assets

Use this to build and watch for changes during development:

```bash
composer run dev
```

> Note: This runs `npm run dev` internally, but keeps everything Laravel-flavored.

---

### Reset the Database

Use this to wipe and re-seed your database:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

---

### Run Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

---

### Format Code

```bash
vendor/bin/pint
```
